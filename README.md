7. Magical Tablet and Fishing
Goodnight. I thoroughly prepared before writing. Let's get down to business
1. Magic tablets. You fixed the. Now there are signs in the drop. Indicated 6%.In fact, for 200 mobs did not fall not one. In Giant Cave for 200 mobs with a chance of 0.9 - 18 tablets.In TOI with shamans with 200 mobs with a chance of 0.9 - 15 tablets. It’s not all that has come to theseThere are practically no skills and needs in the tablets, but after 2-3 they will be worth the pricecoins and more. You have set the price for 31 tablets of 50 coins. I need to pump 8 skills- 400 coins. It will take almost a week to fill the monsters. And when everyone does,there will be a huge shortage of spots and most will not be able to pump their skills for a very long time.First you need to lower the price of Donat coins. Second, fix the drop from the angels-now withthey do not fall for them. Third, increase the drop from the rest of the monsters. If not by chance then at least by quantity. (IT IS WORKING CORRECTLY)

8. Fishing. I fished 3 nights from 12.00 to 13.00 the day. What do I have on hand? 50 fresh mackerel - 80 mackerel -160 chests.It should be at rates x1 140 fresh mackerel 270 mackerel 10 chests. You have problems with catch speed and problems.with chances in chests and mackerels. Please correct it. Where do I get these numbers for the ratio. I compared the same time Fishing on the official server 3 nights. 3 - (Need 3 days to test)

9. Focus PowerHi, TH's skill Focus Power doesn't work at all. I've tested it with my friend and there is no differece in damage to the back with or w/o FP. Not only Focus Power, but every crit. dmg multiplier (Death Whisper, Dance of Fire, Chant of Victory, Prophecies, Vicious Stance and so on) doesn't work here on dagger skills. Let's have faith and hope they will fix it soon. Cuz without those buffs working, dagger-class is really useless. (IT IS WORKING CORRECTLY)

10. Loosing XPHi, Is it normal that I loose 13% of XP on 79 lvl after beeing killed by mob? I though I saw somewhere on forum that supposed to be like 4%. Am I wrong?ç (WITH PROBLEM) - correct would be :
1-19 = 10%
20-79 = 4%
80+ = 1%

11. CC dont work properlywhen CC is activated it increase NORMAL attacks crit dmg,but atm it increase daggers skill dmg aswell pls look at it...(IT IS WORKING CORRECTLY)

12. Magic Critical RATEI did tested 100 nukes on
SPS 85 /full gear bracled duty lvl 6/ tali baium/ hat+wit /Dc set+2wit /bracled +1wit /full epics /cloak // dyes+8 WIt /rune of boots+1 stats
basicly i got 36 Wit + full buffs wm /siren /cov etc
tested with weapon no rune 
100 nukes / 16 crits (16%)
 tested with weapon +feoh super = 15% magic crt rate 
100 nukes / 17 crits (17%)
(WITH PROBLEM) - (super rune 100/13 critical - No rune 100/15)
i asume there is also some luck so lets say its 15-20% crit 
so  i think either magic critical rate cap is not working propperly 
or rune feoh super +15% crt rate not working propperly 

13. (even i think this 15-20%  on this quipe and buff is low chance )
Movement bugI'm getting problems to farm as Dreadnought in the first rooms of Giant's Cave [Current location: 185,784 / 47,320 / -4,344 (Near Town of Aden)] because i have a problem when my char is getting near a corner with all the mobs of the room.

23. MIssing Mobs (IT IS WORKING CORRECTLY)

24. Lethal posion 
Hi there, I found some strange behaviour of poison. Onc upon the time u get some crazy lethal from poison mobs. I saw it on Medusa mobs (34lv I think) and now in GC. The chance is very low, but sometimes hapen that you instantly die. I am not sure if it is during the casting of the poison or poison itself, but this is not definitely how it supose to work. (WITH PROBLEM) every 50 poison 1 gave critical

26. Gladiator's Sonic Rage Bug Gladiator's Sonic Rage (3rd prof. replacement for triple slash) provides way less p.def reduction than intended. It should be stronger than Triple Slash (23% p.def reduction for 10sec). Instead, it provides ~10, maybe 12% (based on my brief tests) for 5 seconds.

33. Rapid Shot does nothing Hi I am a lvl 62 Hawkeye wearing full Doom light with Bow of Peril
Using Rapid Shot shows an increase in attack speed in the character window, but does nothing to actually increase your attack speed. I have 637 speed without buff, and 713 with the buff. Frame by frame, there is no difference in attack speed.
